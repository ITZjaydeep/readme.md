    "1. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - Python is an interpreted language, which can result in slower execution speed compared to compiled languages like C or C++.\n",
    "   - Certain computational tasks, especially those involving heavy computation or low-level system interactions, may be slower in Python compared to other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**:\n",
    "   - The Global Interpreter Lock in Python limits the execution of multiple threads within a single process.\n",
    "   - This can hinder the performance of multi-threaded CPU-bound applications as only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mobile Development**:\n",
    "   - While Python has frameworks like Kivy and BeeWare for mobile app development, it's not as commonly used for mobile development compared to languages like Java (Android) or Swift (iOS).\n",
    "   - Performance and native platform integrations can be limiting factors for mobile development in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resource Consumption**:\n",
    "   - Python can consume more memory compared to lower-level languages due to its dynamic typing and automatic memory management.\n",
    "   - Memory consumption can be a concern for applications that need to scale or run on resource-constrained environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Version Compatibility**:\n",
    "   - Python has had multiple versions released over the years (Python 2.x and Python 3.x), and while efforts have been made to encourage migration to Python 3, there's still a significant amount of code written in Python 2.\n",
    "   - Compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3 can be a challenge for maintaining and updating existing codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Packaging and Distribution**:\n",
    "   - Packaging and distributing Python applications can be complex, especially when dealing with dependencies and different operating systems.\n",
    "   - Dependency management, version conflicts, and ensuring consistent environments across different systems can be challenging tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Threading Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Due to the GIL, Python's threading model may not be suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require parallel execution.\n",
    "   - While asynchronous programming with asyncio can mitigate some of these limitations, it may not be suitable for all use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Compiler Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Python's dynamic nature can make it challenging for compilers to perform optimizations compared to statically typed languages.\n",
    "   - This can result in less efficient compiled code and limited opportunities for compiler optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Community Fragmentation**:\n",
    "   - The Python community is diverse, with multiple frameworks, libraries, and tools available for various tasks.\n",
    "   - While diversity is generally positive, it can also lead to fragmentation, making it harder for developers to choose the best tools and maintain interoperability between different projects."

    "- Python code execution involves several steps, including lexing, parsing, compiling, and interpreting. Here's a high-level overview of how Python code executes internally:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lexing (Tokenization)**:\n",
    "   - The Python interpreter reads the source code and breaks it down into individual tokens such as identifiers, keywords, operators, literals, etc.\n",
    "   - For example, the statement `x = 5 + 3` might be tokenized into `IDENTIFIER(x)`, `ASSIGN`, `INTEGER(5)`, `PLUS`, `INTEGER(3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parsing**:\n",
    "   - The tokens generated from lexing are then organized into a hierarchical structure representing the syntactic structure of the code, known as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\n",
    "   - The AST captures the relationships between different parts of the code, such as expressions, statements, and control flow structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compilation**:\n",
    "   - The AST is compiled into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of the code that the Python interpreter can efficiently execute.\n",
    "   - Each bytecode instruction corresponds to a specific operation, such as loading a value onto the stack, performing an arithmetic operation, or calling a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes the bytecode instruction by instruction.\n",
    "   - The interpreter follows the control flow specified by the bytecode, manipulating the program's state (such as the call stack, variable values, etc.) accordingly.\n",
    "   - When the interpreter encounters function calls or other blocks of code, it may recursively execute those blocks, pushing and popping frames on the call stack to manage function calls and returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Execution**:\n",
    "   - During execution, the interpreter interacts with the Python runtime environment, which provides access to system resources, libraries, and other functionalities.\n",
    "   - Python's dynamic nature allows for features like dynamic typing, memory management (including garbage collection), and runtime introspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, Python's execution process involves translating source code into a series of lower-level instructions (bytecode), which are then executed by the Python interpreter within the runtime environment. This process enables Python to provide both flexibility and performance while executing code."
